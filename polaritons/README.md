# General description 
These are notes on polaritons, modes that arise from the coupling of light with polar materials. 

## Hackmd notes on polaritons

**Clausius-Mossotti relation and local field effects in solids**: https://hackmd.io/@aligho/HkHIPTPaR (These notes derive the main results in *Nagel, S. R., and T. A. Witten Jr. "Local-field effects on inelastic electron scattering." Physical Review B 11.4 (1975): 1623.*

Born and Huang equations: https://hackmd.io/@aligho/HkHIPTPaR

Highly questionable proof of Clausius-Mossotti relations but also some discussion of systems with reduced dimensionality: https://hackmd.io/@aligho/H1cXcTSa0
