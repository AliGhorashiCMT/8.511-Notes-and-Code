# General description 
These are notes on polaritons, modes that arise from the coupling of light with polar materials. 

## Hackmd notes on polaritons

**Clausius-Mossotti relation and local field effects in solids**: https://hackmd.io/@aligho/HkHIPTPaR (These notes derive the main results in *Nagel, S. R., and T. A. Witten Jr. "Local-field effects on inelastic electron scattering." Physical Review B 11.4 (1975): 1623.* In the long wavelength limit, we derive the Clausius-Mossotti relation using a cool dipolar sum derived in *Cohen, Morrel H., and F. Keffer. "Dipolar sums in the primitive cubic lattices." Physical Review 99.4 (1955): 1128.*)

**Born and Huang equations**: [https://hackmd.io/@aligho/HkHIPTPaR](https://hackmd.io/@aligho/BJ-xMSU6A)

**Highly questionable proof of Clausius-Mossotti relations but also some discussion of systems with reduced dimensionality**: https://hackmd.io/@aligho/H1cXcTSa0
