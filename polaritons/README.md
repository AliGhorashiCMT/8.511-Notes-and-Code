# General description 
These are notes on polaritons, modes that arise from the coupling of light with polar materials. 

## Hackmd notes on polaritons

**Clausius-Mossotti relation and local field effects in solids**: https://hackmd.io/@aligho/HkHIPTPaR (These notes derive the main results in *Nagel, S. R., and T. A. Witten Jr. "Local-field effects on inelastic electron scattering." Physical Review B 11.4 (1975): 1623.* In the long wavelength limit, we derive the Clausius-Mossotti relation using a cool dipolar sum derived in *Cohen, Morrel H., and F. Keffer. "Dipolar sums in the primitive cubic lattices." Physical Review 99.4 (1955): 1128.*)

**Born and Huang equations**: [https://hackmd.io/@aligho/HkHIPTPaR](https://hackmd.io/@aligho/BJ-xMSU6A) These notes derive the Born and Huang equations, which are essentially equations of motion for polar ions in a cubic lattice. We first derive the equations in the case where ionic polarizabilities are zero and then generalize to the more annoying case of nonzero ionic polarizabilities. 

**Highly questionable proof of Clausius-Mossotti relations but also some discussion of systems with reduced dimensionality**: https://hackmd.io/@aligho/H1cXcTSa0

**Some questionable recitation notes**: https://hackmd.io/@aligho/SJ3o-LDhR The parts I'm confident about are the discussion on the phonon dispersion, cacluation of the force constants given the phonon dispersion, and the contribution of the Coulomb interaction to the force constants.
