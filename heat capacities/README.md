# General description 
Calculation of heat capacities for fermions (e.g. electrons and holes) and bosons (e.g. phonons and magnons) in two and three dimensions. 

## Hackmd notes on heat capacities

**Notes on fermionic and bosonic heat capacities**: https://hackmd.io/@aligho/HyV_XN1a0 (These were recitation notes so they include some other material, notably Pauli spin susceptibility, in addition 
to the discussion on heat capacities).
