# Topology in condensed matter 

## General description 

The notes and code here concern a range of topological concepts in the context of condensed matter physics: the SSH model/Peierls instability in one dimensional solids, the Haldane model, 
numerical computation of the Berry curvature and the Chern number in time-reversal broken systems, symmetry indicators, Berry phase winding, Thouless pumping, and the Rice-Mele model. 
Also included are links to hackmd documents with solutions to problem sets 9, 10 and 11.
