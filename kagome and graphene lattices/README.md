# General description 
Here, we look at two of the most famous (and fun!) lattices in two dimensions: the graphene and Kagome lattices. In particular, we see how the graphene lattice engenders a linear dispersion at the Brillouin zone corners and how
the Kagome lattice engenders a perfectly flat band throughout the Brillouin zone. In both cases, one obtains electronic properties far removed from the free electron (quadratic dispersion) limit. We go beyond just looking at monolayer 
materials by analyzing both AA and AB graphene bilayers.

## Description of jupyter notebooks

  **Kagome and Graphene.ipynb**: First, we model graphene and Kagome lattice monolayers and calculate their dispersions along high symmetry lines/Brillouin zone boundaries. We next calculate the dispersion of AA bilayer graphene 
  as well as its electronic density of stataes. Lastly, we examine AB bilayer graphene, which has the interesting property that its band gap may be tuned by means of a transverse electric field.
