# 8.511-Notes-and-Code

## General description
This repository contains notes and code used (by me, Ali Ghorashi) during the Fall 2024 semester of 8.511 (Theory of Solids) at MIT. Problem set solutions are provided as hackmd documents. 
These solutions will be made private after the completion of the Fall term. 

## Folder structure 
 **heat capacities**: Pset #2 solutions
 
 **central equation**: Degenerate perturbation theory of the electron gas. Pset #3 solutions (forthcoming)
 
 **tight binding**: An introduction to tight binding models. Includes pset #4 solutions
 
 **kagome and graphene lattices**: Simulations of monolayer kagome lattices and monolayer/bilayer graphene lattices. Includes pset #5 solutions
 
 **quantum oscillations**: Landau levels, SDH oscillations, De Haas-Van Alphen oscillations, Landau diamagnetism, Landau levels in graphene, DC conductivities and their gauge invariance. 
 Includes pset #6 and #7 solutions. 

 **topology**: Chern insulators, non-trivial edge states, calculation of Chern number through a sum over states, Berry phase (and hybrid Wannier center) winding, gauge invariance of conductivity, intraband
 position operator and its relationship to the intraband Berry connection, symmetry indicators for the Chern number. Peierls instability and its scaling. Includes pset #9, #10, and #11 solutions. 

 **practice exam 8.511** and **final exam 8.511** contain solution sets, code, and plots for the practice exam (which was the previous year's final exam) and the Fall 2024 final exam. Most notably, the final exam
 folder contains code for degenerate perturbation theory in a triangular lattice (only including the lowest harmonic of the potential).
