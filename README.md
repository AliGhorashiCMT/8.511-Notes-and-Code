# 8.511-Notes-and-Code

## General description
This repository contains notes and code used (by me, Ali Ghorashi) during the Fall 2024 semester of 8.511 (Theory of Solids) at MIT. Problem set solutions are provided as hackmd documents. 
These solutions will be made private after the completion of the Fall term. 

## Folder structure 
 **heat capacities**: Pset #2 solutions
 
 **central equation**: Degenerate perturbation theory of the electron gas. Pset #3 solutions (forthcoming)
 
 **tight binding**: An introduction to tight binding models. Includes pset #4 solutions
 
 **kagome and graphene lattices**: Simulations of monolayer kagome lattices and monolayer/bilayer graphene lattices. Includes pset #5 solutions
 
 **quantum oscillations**: Landau levels, SDH oscillations, De Haas-Van Alphen oscillations, Landau diamagnetism, Landau levels in graphene, DC conductivities and their gauge invariance. 
 Includes pset #6 and #7 solutions.
